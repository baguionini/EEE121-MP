Fill in the required functions and run sample_script.py using python3.
If your implementation is correct, you should produce the same output as in sample_output.txt.

Keep in mind the following:
 - Do NOT use the "global" keyword.
 - The header script cannot be changed, which means it is not possible to add/modify any method. (Local changes in your machine will be discarded during submission.)
 - Please use the is_equal function in the header script when testing floating-point numbers for equality. Otherwise, your code may be hexed by floating-point black magic.
 - The functions grid_graph and grid_graph_pseudorandom are merely provided for local testing. They may not appear in the (hidden) test script during submission.
 - Keep your functions isolated, since you will be submitting them one at a time. For example, if you a submit a code for Sub-task 2 which contains both "check_constraints" and "is_feasible," only the is_feasible function will be copied and tested.
